<!- matrix transformations for rotation,translation, identiy matrix and such.
	then theres a file with math functions such as degrees to radians.
	and then finally there is a file that is google provided code that makes it so
	that theres a browser independent way to recall a function,aka whenever screen
	refreshes.->

	<script type="text/javascript" src="Util\webgl-utils.js"></script>

<!- shaderBased folder is for all shader based files.
	objectBased folder is where predefined objects like cubes and pyramids will be
	probably should use inheriance but idk how to do that in javascript.
	finally Init folder is the files that run for the first them when the main html file is clicked->

<!- These files effect/affect the view portion of this program directly, viewMatrix is 
	the matrix that basicly says where 'eye' is looking at.
	calculation and draw file are both called right after eachother whenever the screen is ready
	to be refreshed. aka at every tick the program calculates positions of objects and then draws them.
	in the future these calculatiosn will be moved to the shaders as the gpu is much faster at mathz->

    function webGLStart() {
		//@@@@@yes yes yes ik I should pass the canvas id in rather then hard coding it in
		//but alas idk how to do that with html,plz halp .
        var canvas = document.getElementById("lesson04-canvas");
		
		//inits the GL functions.
        initGL(canvas);
		
		//inits shaders. shaders shade.
        initShaders()
		
		//init buffers, aka create any objects that are going to be in the world at start.
        initBuffers();

		//make the background black.
        gl.clearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
		
		//enable depth aka projective view.
        gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
		
		//the calculation-draw file caller, whenever the screen is 
		//ready to refresh,this tick calls it.
        tick();

<body onload="webGLStart();">
    
	<!- @@@@@how can I have it where html gets the size of the window oh and the canvas id mentioned before ->
    <canvas id="lesson04-canvas" style="border: none;" width="1920" height="1080"></canvas>
